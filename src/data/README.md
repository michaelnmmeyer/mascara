Before adding a new word to one of the *.txt files:

*  Replace ASCII ligatures (ae, etc.) with their Unicode equivalents (Ã¦, etc.).

   We generate automatically all possible forms.

*  Replace Unicode single quotes with the ASCII equivalent ('). Do the same for
   hyphens.

*  Escape the character # with a backslash.

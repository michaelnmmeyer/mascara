.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Overview
Mascara is a natural language tokenizer. It segments a text into graphemes,
tokens, or sentences.

A text file encoded in UTF-8 is expected as input. Unicode NFC normalization is
performed on the input text before it is segmented. If no file name is given,
the standard input is read.
